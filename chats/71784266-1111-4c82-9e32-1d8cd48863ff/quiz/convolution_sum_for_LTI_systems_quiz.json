You've decided to use a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system to process the signals. What does this mean? An LTI system is a system where the output is directly proportional to the input, and the proportionality constant is the same for all inputs.", "mood": "good"}, {"text": "In other words, an LTI system is like a filter that changes the shape of the input signal, but doesn't change its overall size. This is useful for many applications, like compressing audio files. You've chosen to use an LTI system for your project because it's simpler and more efficient than other types of systems.", "mood": "good"}, {"text": "Now, you need to analyze the system's response to different inputs. This is where convolution comes in. Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines the system's impulse response with the input signal. The result is the system's output. In the context of LTI systems, the impulse response is also called the system's kernel or filter.", "mood": "neutral"}, {"text": "The formula for convolution is: Output = \u222b(System's impulse response * Input signal) dt. This equation says that the output is the integral of the system's impulse response multiplied by the input signal, over all time. This is the core concept behind convolution in LTI systems.", "mood": "good"}, {"text": "But there's a catch! Convolution can be computationally expensive, especially for complex systems. This is where the concept of the convolution sum comes in. The convolution sum is a way to approximate the convolution integral, by summing up the system's impulse response and the input signal over discrete time points. This is useful for real-time processing and efficient implementation.", "mood": "neutral"}]}}
