In the context of LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) systems, convolution can be thought of as the representation of an LTI system as the convolution of the input with an impulse response. This concept has many useful properties, such as being associative and commutative, which carry over to LTI systems. It's also helpful for understanding composition of system blocks and the order of system blocks, making it a useful tool both practically and theoretically. However, it's worth noting that while the concept is simple, it can be tedious to apply in complex systems, leading to a desire for alternative methods.", "is_user": false, "timestamp": "2024-09-21T18:04:34.926968"}]
