In C++, OOP is a way to organize code into reusable blueprints called classes. These classes can be used to create objects that represent real-world entities, like a car or a bank account. Classes define the structure and behavior of these objects. Let's start our journey into the world of OOP!", "mood": "good"}, {"text": "In C++, a class is defined using the keyword 'class' followed by the name of the class. For example, we might define a 'Car' class with properties like 'color' and 'make'. Classes can also have methods, which are actions that can be performed on the object. For instance, we might have a 'drive' method that lets us simulate the car moving.", "mood": "neutral"}, {"text": "Now, let's create an object from our 'Car' class. We do this by using the 'new' keyword followed by the name of the class. For example, we might create a 'myCar' object by saying 'Car* myCar = new Car();'.
