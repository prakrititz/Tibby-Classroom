## Introduction

Welcome to Tibby's Classroom, a submission for the Python + GEN AI Hackathon! This project showcases the integration of a chatbot designed to enhance educational experiences by creating visual summaries, generating mind maps, quizzes, and summarizing PDFs based on user input.

Tibby's Classroom makes learning interactive and exciting by allowing students to engage with content through visual summaries, mind maps, and quizzes. The chatbot, Tibby, also adapts its expressions based on the images in the visual summaries, making the experience more dynamic and personalized.
## Features

- **Visual Summaries**: Enter a topic, and Tibby generates a visual summary complete with images. Tibby also adapts its expressions based on the image content to create a more engaging interaction.
  
- **PDF Summarization**: Upload a PDF file, and Tibby will extract key points and create concise summaries.
- **Quiz Generation**: Based on the input topic, Tibby creates quizzes to test knowledge and reinforce learning.
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Tibbyâ€™s friendly persona and changing expressions make the learning process more engaging.
- **Gamification and Friends System**: Users can create accounts, track progress, and compete with friends on quizzes and topic mastery, similar to platforms like LeetCode. Progress tracking, leaderboards, and quiz scores foster a competitive learning environment that encourages engagement and collaboration.

## How Tibby Works

1. **Input**: The user provides a topic or uploads a PDF file.
2. **Processing**: Using Python and Gen AI, Tibby processes the input to generate a visual summary, mind map, or quiz. It can also summarize PDFs to extract essential information.
3. **Visual Output**: Tibby generates summaries with accompanying images, which are then displayed with an interactive chatbot interface. Tibbyâ€™s expression changes based on the image content to reflect the tone of the summary.
4. **Quiz Generation**: Tibby prepares a set of questions based on the topic, helping users self-test and solidify their understanding.
